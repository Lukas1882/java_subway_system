java_subway_system
==================

A new algrithm to find shortest routing in a subway system, in java.


This is a project in my course done by myself.
I first build a subway system, with different lines, stations (nodes), timetable for the stations and a subway system map.
Then, I build a new algorithm to find the shortest routing from two stations. I also build a compare algorithm to check the result.
The compare algorithm just try to find all the routing then pick the one use the shortest time.

In my system,diffent lines may have differnt timetable, that'a huge work for me to make the input. So, if you want to check 
the algorithm, just better use the start time before 10 AM in the java program.
